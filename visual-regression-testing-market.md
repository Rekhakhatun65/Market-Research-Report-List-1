<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Visual Regression Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Testing</li><li>Automation Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Visual regression testing is crucial in ensuring that changes in code do not unintentionally alter the appearance of an application. The market for manual testing involves human testers who visually compare UI changes and identify discrepancies, often leading to time-consuming processes. In contrast, the automation testing market employs tools and software to automatically detect visual differences, enhancing efficiency and consistency. Both markets play vital roles in maintaining user experience, but automation is increasingly favored for its speed and scalability.</p></p>
