<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automatic Vacuum Packaging Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>V-FFS</li><li>H-FFS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fully automatic vacuum packaging machine market is primarily segmented into two types: Vertical Form-Fill-Seal (V-FFS) and Horizontal Form-Fill-Seal (H-FFS). V-FFS machines operate vertically, forming bags from a film roll, filling them with product, and sealing the bags in an upward motion, ideal for liquid and granular products. H-FFS machines, on the other hand, operate horizontally, suitable for larger, flat products, offering greater packaging flexibility and efficiency. Both types enhance shelf life and protect contents from spoilage.</p></p>
