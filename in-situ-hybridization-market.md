<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In-Situ Hybridization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radioactive isotopes</li><li>Non-radioactive labels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The In-Situ Hybridization market is segmented into two primary types based on labeling methods: radioactive isotopes and non-radioactive labels. Radioactive isotopes involve using radiolabeled probes, allowing for highly sensitive detection through autoradiography, but require careful handling due to safety concerns. Non-radioactive labels, such as fluorescent dyes or enzyme-based tags, offer a safer alternative with the advantage of visualization through techniques like fluorescence microscopy and chromogenic detection. Both methods cater to specific research needs in gene expression and localization studies.</p></p>
