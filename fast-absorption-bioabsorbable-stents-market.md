<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fast- absorption Bioabsorbable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer-based Stents</li><li>Metallic Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fast-absorption bioabsorbable stent market comprises mainly two types: polymer-based and metallic stents. Polymer-based stents are made from biodegradable materials that gradually dissolve, reducing long-term complications and promoting vessel healing. Metallic stents, while still bioabsorbable, use metals that may offer greater strength and flexibility initially but also dissolve over time. Both types are designed to support arterial structures temporarily, allowing for natural tissue regeneration while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions and restenosis.</p></p>
