<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-healing Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Healing</li><li>Capsule Based Healing</li><li>Vascular Healing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-healing concrete market is categorized into three main types: intrinsic healing, capsule-based healing, and vascular healing. Intrinsic healing relies on the concrete's natural properties to heal minor cracks through ongoing hydration. Capsule-based healing involves embedding capsules filled with healing agents that release when cracks form, promoting repair. Vascular healing features a network of capillaries that transport healing materials, actively seeking out and mending cracks. Together, these methods enhance the longevity and durability of concrete structures.</p></p>
