<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Anti-pinch Power Window System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive anti-pinch power window system market comprises two main types: automatic and manual systems. Automatic systems utilize sensors to detect obstruction and prevent the window from closing, enhancing passenger safety. They typically feature mechanisms that reverse the window's movement upon encountering resistance. Manual systems, on the other hand, require the user to operate the window via a physical mechanism, often lacking advanced safety features. The automatic segment is gaining traction due to increasing safety regulations and consumer demand for enhanced convenience.</p></p>
